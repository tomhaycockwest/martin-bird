                <p class="copy">MLB Carpentry was established in 2009, working in the West London area I have built up a steady business operating purely on word of mouth and recommendations from repeat customers.</p>

                <p class="copy">I studied at Acton West London College where I completed my three year apprenticeship working for a high end construction company and gained a NVQ Level 2 and NVQ Level 3 in site carpentry, in which I finished with a credit and a distinction and was named apprentice of the year. During this time I was also asked to represent the college in Joinery competitions at regional level where I came first two years in a row and progressed to compete at National level.</p> 

                <p class="copy">Over the last 6 and a half years I have gained a huge amount of experience working on projects from Loft conversions to custom made fitted wardrobes - this experience allows me to work alongside my customers giving them the best advice whilst making sure that I stick to the specification that they have given me.</p> 

                <p class="copy">I cover all aspects of carpentry and am able to take on and project manage a job from start to finish, from fitting out a full kitchen to hanging a door - I treat every job the same ensuring the highest quality of finish.</p> 

                <p class="copy">If you have any questions or would like some advice please do not hesitate to get in contact, I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
